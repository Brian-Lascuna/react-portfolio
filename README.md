# React Portfolio

## Description
A React app used to create a personal portfolio, showcasing myself and all the accumulated projects that I have worked on while, at the same time, practicing the usage of React to create a portfolio that can stand out from the rest. The portfolio showcases an About page as well as six different projects. Visitors can also submit a form to allow me to contact them at a later date. As of currently, the portfolio is unfinished.

## Installation
All packages are installed on the deployed webpage, users viewing it on their local machine must use the 'npm install' or 'npm i' commands.

## Usage
Visitors will be brought to the 'About' page upon loading the webpage. The navbar at the top allows you to navigate through the webpage, allowing access to the actual portfolio, the contact page, and (soon-to-be implemented) resume. In the future, projects in the portfolio can be clicked to be inspected and allow traversal to either the project webpage or the repository.

The portfolio can be viewed [here](https://brian-lascuna.github.io/react-portfolio/).
